### About

I’ve been in the so called ‘Crypto Space’ since the 2017 bull run. Back then I was clueless and spent far too much money on things that, let’s say…weren’t Bitcoin. In the 3 years that have passed, it’s fair to say that I’ve become well and truly coin monogamous. Bitcoin has me hooked and every day is a quest to stay up to date, learn about the latest developments, listen to the latest podcast or read the latest article.

As my knowledge has slowly started to grow (I still have a lot to learn), I began to try and give back through education. I am not a programmer or developer, nor do I have any prior technical experience. I have been fortunate enough to speak regularly with some smart and generous people who help me understand these complex topics, which I then try to present in an approachable way for others to learn.

This page is a single collection of my contributions that I can point people towards when starting out. If you find it valuable, please share it with your peers.
